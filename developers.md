## Technology

The foia-hub is a Python/Django application.

Most of the scripts written to collect data are also written in Python. See:
[scripts source](https://github.com/18F/foia/tree/master/contacts).

## API

All of the information that our <a href="https://foia.18f.us">FOIA-hub</a>
presents is available through an API. 

[API documentation](http://foia-hub.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## Bulk Data

The data source for the API and the tool is a set of YAML files that contain
all the data. These files are the canonical source for our data and are updated
through a combination of automated and manual processes.
