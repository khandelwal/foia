## API

All of the information that our <a href="https://foia.18f.us">FOIA-hub</a>
presents is available through an API. 

[API documentation](http://foia-hub.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## Bulk Data

The data source for the API and the tool is a set of YAML files that contain
all the data. These files are the canonical source for our data and are updated
through a combination of automated and manual processes.
