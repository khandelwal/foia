## Features

- #### UP-TO-DATE CONTACT INFORMATION
FOIA-hub provides a single, easily search source for contact information for
FOIA offices within various agencies and components of the United States
Government. 

- #### KEYWORD SEARCH
Navigating the federal government hierarchy to determine where to submit a FOIA
request is not easy. FOIA-hub provides keyword search to help requesters
navigate to the appropriate agency or office within.  For example, a search for
'benzene' brings up the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of
Homeland Security. 

- #### FOIA LIBRARIES
Many agencies provide oft-requested responsive documents in online reading
rooms or libraries. FOIA-hub collects and provides links ot these online
libraries. It is hoped that potential requesters will check the libraries
first, before submitting a request. 

## Technology

The foia-hub is a Python/Django application.

Most of the scripts written to collect data are also written in Python. (see:
(https://github.com/18F/foia/tree/master/contacts)[scripts source])
